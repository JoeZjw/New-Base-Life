# Zip Game — Deployable to Base Chain

A minimal blockchain "Zip" game (lottery/race-style) smart contract + simple frontend that can be deployed to Base (testnet/mainnet). This repo includes:

- Solidity contract: `contracts/ZipGame.sol`
- Hardhat scripts to compile and deploy
- Simple web frontend (vanilla JS) to interact with the contract
- Instructions to deploy to Base and run locally

This project is meant as a demonstration and NOT production-ready (randomness uses blockhash, which can be manipulated by miners; do not use for high-value games).

Quick features
- Start a round with entry price, max players, and duration
- Players join by sending entryFee
- After round ends anyone can finalize the round; winner chosen pseudo-randomly from participants
- Winner receives the pot minus a small platform fee that owner can withdraw

Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 18
- yarn or npm
- A Base RPC URL (Base testnet/mainnet or Base Goerli depending on current network naming). Use a provider like Alchemy/Infura or a public RPC.
- Private key with testnet funds for deployment

Files
- contracts/ZipGame.sol — solidity game contract
- hardhat.config.js — Hardhat config (networks use env vars)
- scripts/deploy.js — deployment script
- frontend/* — static frontend to interact with the contract

Usage

1) Clone or copy files, then install deps:
   - yarn install
   or
   - npm install

2) Create a `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`) and set:
   - BASE_RPC_URL — RPC endpoint for Base testnet or mainnet
   - PRIVATE_KEY — deployer private key (without 0x or with — accepted by Hardhat)
   - ETHERSCAN_API_KEY — optional (for verifying on Etherscan if supported for Base)

3) Compile:
   - npx hardhat compile

4) Deploy to Base (example):
   - npx hardhat run --network baseTestnet scripts/deploy.js

   After deploy you'll see the contract address. Use the frontend to interact.

Frontend
- Serve the `frontend` folder (e.g., npx http-server frontend) or open `frontend/index.html` directly (Metamask allows local file access depending on browser).
- The frontend expects you to paste the deployed contract address (or the script outputs one into `deployments.txt` if you save it).

Security notes
- Randomness uses blockhash and is not secure for high-value games.
- Owner controls starting rounds and withdrawing fees.
- Always audit contracts before production use.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add Chainlink VRF integration for secure randomness
- Add unit tests and CI
- Convert to a full React frontend
- Bundle everything into a ready-to-download ZIP

Next: I included all files below. Follow the README to set env and deploy.
